# Part 3.

This part constists of writing an email addressed to a high placed manager of the company I am working for in order to convince him to give me a project's full responsibility.

## Context

This time, I tries to convince the CEO of OCTO Technology to give me a budget in order to produce and start the *CarValley* project in the San Francisco bay area.

Few weeks before I send this email, we had a brown bag lunch (BBL) about intrapreneurship. A BBL is a meeting organized at lunch time in order to discuss about a topic. At this occasion, I talked with him about the affiliate OCTO started at San Francisco. He explained to me it was complicated to find interesting clients there because they are used to invest in promising startup teams, and they do not believe in IT service/consulting that much.
