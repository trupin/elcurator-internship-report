#ElCurator - The developer's beginning guide

Just like software, this document will rot unless we take care of it. We encourage you to help us on that by giving us your feedbacks.

## What is this document for?

If you are reading this, you probably just arrived in the elCurator's developers team. First of all, welcome, and congratulation.

Because we are aware there is a lot of informations to absorb during your first days, we try to keep this document up to date in order to give you a point of reference concerning our team, our product and our methodologies. You also will get a good idea of what we think a good developer is.

This document is obviously targeting the developers, but we put all our efforts to make it understandable by everybody. If you are curious about what we are doing at elCurator, and even if you are not a developer, this document should still be interesting, and we hope it will statisfy your curiosity.

## An inner-enterprise

It is acutally quite difficult to tell exactly what elCurator is. Is it a start-up, an enterprise, how is OCTO Technology related to us? We imagine you are wondering all these things, and it is very important to clarify this point.
