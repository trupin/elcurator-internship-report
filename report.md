#ElCurator - The developer's beginning guide

Just like software, this document will rot unless we take care of it. We encourage you to help us on that by giving us your feedbacks.

## What is this document for?

If you are reading this, you probably just arrived in the elCurator's developers team. First of all, welcome, and congratulation.

Because we are aware there is a lot of informations to absorb during your first days, we try to keep this document up to date in order to give you a point of reference concerning our team, our product and our methodologies. You also will get a good idea of what we think a good developer is.

This document is obviously targeting the developers, but we put all our efforts to make it understandable by everybody. If you are curious about what we are doing at elCurator, and even if you are not a developer, this document should still be interesting, and we hope it will statisfy your curiosity.

## An inner-enterprise

It is acutally quite difficult to tell exactly what elCurator is. Is it a start-up, an enterprise, how is OCTO Technology related to us? We imagine you are wondering all these things, and it is very important to clarify this point.

### From the one day hacking project, to the affiliate

ElCurator was initiated by two consultants of OCTO Technology in 2012 during a particular day called the OCTO day. This event is happening once in a year, and is aimed to let every employees work on whatever they want, since it profits to their colleagues. 

That day, Christopher Parola - now CEO of the company - started the project with several workmates, and in one day of work, they tried to make a working prototype. This prototype was a failure since it wasn't working as expected, and Christopher continued to work on it on his free time. Jeremy Venezia - now CTO of the company - joined him several weeks after that, and helped him in his task. The project began to work, and a few consultants at OCTO started using it. With time, more and more people were using it, and Christopher and Jeremy decided to deploy it to the whole company. Maintaining the project was taking to much time, and the two consultants asked to be only working on it. That's how elCurator began to live, as a project funded by OCTO Technology. In July 2014, the project has been released and OCTO Technology started to communicate on it in order to sell it to other companies (mainly to clients of the company). In January 2015, the project has been affiliated, and it became a company named elCurator.

We can say that elCurator is not really a start-up, but more an inner-enterprise, because it really started from the inside of OCTO Technology, but has been directed by two consultants, to then become an affiliate.

### Our legacy

As we just said, elCurator started living from the inside of OCTO Technology, thanks to its community. Its two creators are former consultants. We are all the time in relationship with other consultants of the company. This is actually a good thing since the OCTO Technology is a  very powerful community, full of experts of a large range of topics (the [OCTO blog](http://blog.octo.com/) is a good demonstration of this). This is obviously influencing our way of working together, our methologies, etc... It is like a legacy to us, which is very important and resourceful. We will talk about this in more details in the next parts of this document.
