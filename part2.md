# Part 2

This part consists of writing an email addressed to my training supervisor in order to convince him to integrate me in a new project team.

## Context

The project I am asking to work on is called *CarValley*. It is a carpool application willing to be used by people working at Palo Alto, but living elsewhere in the bay area. This project is special because it will be initiated with a team already working in San Francisco. They already took the market temparature and they are very enthusiastic about the product value.
