# Part 2. 

This part consists of writing an email addressed to my training supervisor in order to convince him to integrate me in a new project team.

## Context

The project I am asking to work on is called *CarValley*. It is a carpool application willing to be used by people working at Palo Alto, but living elsewhere in the bay area. This project is special because it will be initiated with a team already working in San Francisco. They already took the market temparature and they are very enthusiastic about the product value.

Me to David Alia 08/20/2015


Hello David,

I hope everything is going well in California.

I have just read the mail you sent on the our mailing list in which you ask for motivated developers to work on the *CarValley* mobile application.

As you already know, I am very interested by this idea from its begining and I think it is wonderful that the OCTO's administration finally decided to start its production.

I am currently finishing my internship on the *elCurator* project where I initiated their mobile applications production. I know pretty well Android/iOS and their environment, which means I could make myself very useful to help developing *CarValley*.

My end of study project was to develop an application backend with high data concurrency problematics to solve. I think my backend skills could be appreciated for a project like *CarValley* as well.

We are using lean startup and agile methodologies at *elCurator* to develop the product, which means I know the basics on this topics too. I suppose the product will quicly have to evolve depending on the first users' feedbacks, and I believe these methods can be very helpful to do so.

I really loved to be working on a challenging product and I would like to continue on this way. Being a developer on a project like *elCurator* or *CarValley* is not only technical. It needs all team to be involved in the project life. This is what I find the more stimulating.

I also lived in California for 8 months during my studies, and I know pretty well the bay area. Some people who work there already told me that they would use a tool like *CarValley* if one were existing. I would really enjoy discovering this region a little deeper.

I know I don't have a lot of professional background, but I still have a large range of skills and I think you will need fully operational people like me to quickly get results on *CarValley*.

I am fully available if you need to discuss about my candidature.

Best regards
