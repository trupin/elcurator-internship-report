# Part 2. 

This part consists of writing an email addressed to my training supervisor in order to convince him to integrate me in a new project team.

## Context

The project I am asking to work on is called *CarValley*. It is a carpool application willing to be used by people working at Palo Alto, but living elsewhere in the bay area. This project is special because it will be initiated with a team already working in San Francisco. They already took the market temparature and they are very enthusiastic about the product value.

###### Candidature, mobile deloper, CarValley

Hello David,

I hope everything is going well in California.

I have just read the mail you sent on our mailing list in which you ask for motivated developers to work on the *CarValley* mobile application.

As you already know, I am very interested by this idea from its begining and I think it is wonderful that the OCTO's administration finally decided to start its production.

I am currently finishing my internship on the *elCurator* project where I initiated their mobile applications production. I know pretty well Android/iOS and their environment, which means I could make myself very useful to help developing *CarValley*.

My end of study project was to develop an application backend with high data concurrency problematics to solve. I think my backend skills could be appreciated for a project like *CarValley* as well.

We are using lean startup and agile methodologies at *elCurator* to develop the product, which means I know the basics on this topics too. I suppose the product will quickly have to evolve depending on the first users' feedbacks, and I believe these methods can be very helpful to do so.

I really loved to be working on a challenging product and I would like to continue on this way. Being a developer on a project like *elCurator* or *CarValley* is not only technical. It needs the whole team to be involved in the project life. This is what I find the most stimulating.

I also lived in California for 8 months during my studies, and I know pretty well the bay area. By the way, some people who working there told me that they would use a tool like *CarValley* if one were existing. English is not an issue to me. I actually like to communicate in english. Of course, I would really enjoy discovering this beautiful area a little deeper.

I know I don't have so much professional background, but I still have a large range of skills and I think you will need fully operational people like me to quickly get results on *CarValley*.

I am fully available to talk with you about my candidature.

Best regards

# Part 3.

This part constists of writing an email addressed to a high placed manager of the company I am working for in order to convince him to give me a project's full responsibility.

## Context

The project I am asking to work on is the same one as in the previous part, but at a diferent stage of the project.

In this context, I would try to convince the CEO of OCTO Technology to give me a budget in order to produce and start the *CarValley* project in the bay area.

Few weeks before I send this email, we had a brown bag lunch (BBL) about intrapreneurship. A BBL is a meeting we at lunch time in order to discuss about a topic. That day I had the occasion to talk with him about the affiliate OCTO started at San Francisco. He explained it was complicated to sign big contracts there because they are used to invest in promising startup teams, and they does not believe to IT service/consulting so much.

OCTO Technology is a company where the administration is transparent with the employees. It is actually normal to talk about sports at lunch time with the company's CEO with no embarassment.

###### And what if we started a startup owned by OCTO in San Francisco?
	
Hello François,

I do not know if you remember the dicussion we had at the last BBL. It was about intrapreneurship. Anyway, I remember. It was very interesting, and I thank you for that. It is actually pretty rare to be able to communicate directly to the company's director with such simplicity.
