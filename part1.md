# Part 1

This part consists of writing a reference guide for newcomers at elCurator

## Context

During my internship I have been in charge of the development of a RESTful API and the mobiles applications at elCurator (iOS/Android).

I also participated to develop some of the web features, installed the continuous integration server, written several blog posts, gave an internal conference on a technical topic.

Since elCurator is a start-up project, I had to be autonomous on many points, and I also needed to get involved in the project life.

In this document, I try to give all the necessary informations to quickly be able develop on the web, Android and iOS applications, but also to understand the used methodologies and work with the elCurator's team.
