###### Candidature, mobile deloper, CarValley

Hello David,

I hope everything is going well in California.

I have just read the mail you sent on our mailing list in which you ask for motivated developers to work on the *CarValley* mobile application.

As you already know, I am very interested by this idea from its begining and I think it is wonderful that the OCTO's administration finally decided to start its production.

I am currently finishing my internship on the *elCurator* project where I initiated their mobile applications production. I know pretty well Android/iOS and their environment, which means I could make myself very useful to help developing *CarValley*.

My end of study project was to develop an application backend with high data concurrency problematics to solve. I think my backend skills could be appreciated for a project like *CarValley* as well.

We are using lean startup and agile methodologies at *elCurator* to develop the product, which means I know the basics on this topics too. I suppose the product will quickly have to evolve depending on the first users' feedbacks, and I believe these methods can be very helpful to do so.

I really loved to be working on a challenging product and I would like to continue on this way. Being a developer on a project like *elCurator* or *CarValley* is not only technical. It needs the whole team to be involved in the project life. This is what I find the most stimulating.

I also lived in California for 8 months during my studies, and I know pretty well the bay area. By the way, some people working there told me they would use a tool like *CarValley* if one were existing. English is not an issue to me. I actually like to communicate in english. And of course, I would really enjoy discovering this beautiful area a little deeper.

Even I don't have so much professional background, I still have a large range of skills and I think you will need fully operational people like me to quickly get results on *CarValley*.

I am fully available to talk with you about my candidature.

Best regards
